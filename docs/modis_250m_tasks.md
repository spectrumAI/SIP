# A list of applications using MODIS data and other open data 

* Land cover change detection from MOD13Q1 time series of 2010 and 2015, using Canada 2010 and 2015 30m land cover map as ground truth of land cover changes. 

* Key land cover class fraction estimation from MOD13Q1 time series, using Canada 2010 or 2015 30m land cover map for calculating the ground truth land cover fraction values. 

* Subpixel mapping at 125m from MOD13Q1 250m time series, using Canada 2010 or 2015 30m land cover map to calculate 250m ground truth abundance maps or 125m ground truth maps of land cover classes. 

* For 250m land cover classification, train with mixed pixel abundances as a regression issue vs. train with dominating class label as a classification issue, which approach performs better?
